# Chapter 21

Clean empty virtue  
comes from following the Way.

The Way is elusive, intangible.  
It is elusive, intangible,  
but within there is image.  
It is intangible, elusive,  
but within there is form.  
It is dim and dark,  
but within there is essence,  
true essence,  
and within there is heart.

Throughout the ages  
its name has not changed  
and so we can trace the beginning.

How do we know the beginning?  
By this.
