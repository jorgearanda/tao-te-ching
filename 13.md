# Chapter 13

Receiving favour is a warning.  
Suffering comes from the self.

Why is favour a warning?  
Favour debases: it captures us;  
it makes us afraid to lose it.  

Why does suffering come from the self?  
We only feel because we have a self.  
Without a self there would be no suffering.

Those who care for themselves as much as the world  
can have the world's trust.  
Those who love themselves as much as the world  
would be worthy to govern.
