# Chapter 13

Favour and disgrace lead to fear.  
Honour and suffering come from to the body.

Why do favour and disgrace lead to fear?  
Favour debases: we fear to lose it.  
Disgrace arises from favour.  
So living in favour or disgrace is living in fear.

Why do honour and suffering come from to the body?  
We feel them because we have a body.  
Without a body there would be no suffering.

Those who honour their body as much as the world  
can have the world's trust.  
Those who love their body as much as the world  
would be worthy to govern.
