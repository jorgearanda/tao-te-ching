# Chapter 20

Yes and no,  
beauty and ugliness,  
are not too far apart.  
If we fear what others fear,  
then fear would have no bounds.

People are cheerful, as if at a festival,  
but I sit unmoved,  
like a baby too young to smile.

Lost, homeless.  
Others have plenty; I am forgotten.

Foolish, simple.  
Others are bright; I am dim.  
Others are certain; I am confused.

I recede like the ocean; I drift.  
Others have goals; I am aimless.  
I differ.  
The Mother nourishes me.
