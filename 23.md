# Chapter 23

Nature says few words.  
A gale does not last all morning;  
a squall does not last all day.  
If nature does not need to ramble on,  
neither do we.

Let those on the Way be one with the Way.  
Let those who succeed be one with success.  
Let those who fail be one with failure.

Be one with success—for the Way succeeds too.  
Be one with failure—for the Way fails too.
