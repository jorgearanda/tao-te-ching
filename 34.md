# Chapter 34

The Way drifts unrestrainedâ€”  
it can go left or right.  

Everything lives by its grace  
but it does not speak.  
When its work succeeds  
it claims no merit.  
It has no desires.  
Shall we call it small?

Everything turns to it  
but it wields no control.  
Shall we call it great?

It is because sages never act great  
that they can achieve greatness.
