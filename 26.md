# Chapter 26

Heavy grounds light.  
Still masters restless.

Thus the wise may travel all day  
but never far from their supplies.  
Even if the views are glorious  
they stay serene, undisturbed.

Why would great leaders allow in themselves  
more flimsiness than in their people?  
Unstable, they lose their base.  
Busy, they lose their command.
