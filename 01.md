# Chapter 1

The way that can be shown is not the true Way.  
The name that can be said is not the true name.

The source of the world is nameless.  
Naming is the mother of all particular things.

Desireless, one sees the essence.  
Desiring, one sees its manifestations.

Essence and manifestations have the same origin:  
mystery.

Mystery of mysteries:  
the gate to understanding.
