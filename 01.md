# Chapter 1

The way that can be shown is not the true way.  
The name that can be said is not the true name.

The nameless is the source of it all;  
naming is the mother of the ten thousand things.

Desireless, one sees the mystery.  
Desiring, one sees manifestations.

Mystery and manifestations have the same origin:  
darkness.

Darkness within darkness,  
the gate to understanding.
