# Chapter 22

Partial means whole.  
Crooked means straight.  
Hollow means full.  
Worn out means new.  
Less means content.  
More means confused.

So the wise embrace the One  
and set an example to all.  
Not watching themselves, they appear.  
Not displaying themselves, they flourish.  
Not flattering themselves, they succeed.  
Not parading themselves, they lead.  
Since they do not compete  
no one can compete against them.

The ancients who said "partial means whole"  
came close.  
Becoming whole depends on this.
