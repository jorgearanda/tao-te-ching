# Chapter 19

Get rid of cleverness  
and everyone will be better off.  
Get rid of righteousness  
and people will love again.  
Get rid of greed  
and thieves will cease to exist.

But this is not enough.  
So also wear the undyed cloth,  
hold the uncarved wood,  
reduce selfishness,  
limit desires.

Without knowledge problems vanish.
