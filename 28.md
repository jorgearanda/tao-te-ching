# Chapter 28

Recognize the male,  
but hold onto the female  
and be a ravine for the world.  
As a ravine,  
you will keep your ancient virtue,  
and with it  
you will be a newborn child again.

Recognize the white,  
but hold onto the black  
and be a guide for the world.  
As a guide,  
do not stray from ancient virtue,  
so without straying  
you will be boundless again.

Recognize the pure,  
but hold onto the muck  
and be a valley for the world.  
As a valley,  
you will be filled with ancient virtue,  
and so filled  
you will be uncarved wood again.

Uncarved wood can be cut to made tools,  
but the wise, uncarved, is not a tool:  
a master tailor does not cut.
