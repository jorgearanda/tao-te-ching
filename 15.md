# Chapter 15

The wise of old  
were subtle and discerning.  
Their wisdom was beyond comprehension;  
I can only describe what they seemed like.

They were careful, as if crossing a river in winter,  
watchful, as if meeting danger from every side,  
corteous, as house guests,  
yielding, as melting ice,  
simple, as uncarved wood,  
open, as valleys,  
inscrutable, as murky water.

But murky water becomes clear when it is still  
and stillness comes to life through right action.  

To follow this Way  
do not aim for fulfillment.  
Never full, one can remain a hidden sprout  
and not rush to an early ripening.
