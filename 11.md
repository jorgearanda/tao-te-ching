# Chapter 11

We join spokes in a wheel,  
but it is the central hole  
that makes the cart move.

We mold clay into a pot,  
but it is the hollow inside  
that makes it a vessel.

We hammer wood for a house,  
but it is the space inside  
that makes it livable.

We work with the substantial,  
but the emptiness is what we use.
