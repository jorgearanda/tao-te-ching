# Chapter 2

We see beauty as beauty and we make ugliness.  
We see good and we make evil.

For being and non-being create each other;  
hard and easy complement each other;  
long and short define each other;  
high and low contrast each other;  
tone and voice harmonize each other;  
front and back follow each other.

Therefore the wise does without doing,  
and teaches without talking.  
Things rise and the wise bears them,  
rears them, but does not possess them,  
does the work yet claims no merit.  
It is by not laying claim  
that merit remains.
