# Chapter 2

We see beauty as beauty and we make ugliness.  
We see the good, and we make evil.

For being and non-being create each other;  
hard and easy complement each other;  
long and short define each other;  
high and low depend on each other;  
note and voice harmonize each other;  
front and back follow each other.

Therefore the wise does without doing,  
teaches without talking.  
The ten thousand things rise and fall,  
and the wise bears without attachment,  
acts without laying claim,  
does the work and forgets it.  
That is why it lasts forever.
