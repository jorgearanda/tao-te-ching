# Chapter 27

Good walking leaves no tracks;  
good talking shows no flaws;  
good counting needs no tools.  
Good doors have no locks  
yet they cannot be opened.  
Good knots have no ropes  
yet they cannot be undone.

So the wise save without salvation.  
They abandon no one and nothing  
â€”but they cloak their light.

The good may teach the bad  
and the bad learn from the good.  
But without honouring their teachers  
nor cherishing their students,  
the wise, alone, blind,  
look into the distance.
