# Chapter 5

Nature is unsentimental;  
it treats all creatures like straw dogs.  
Unsentimental are the wise,  
treating people like straw dogs.

Nature is like a bellows:  
empty but inexhaustible,  
each movement producing more.  
Whereas words soon lose their strengthâ€”  
better to keep them inside.
