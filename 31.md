# Chapter 31

Even fine weapons bear ill omens.  
Some things are simply bad,  
and the wise avoid them.

Weapons bear ill omens,  
and are not a leader's tools:  
they wield them only when they must,  
without passion nor praise.  
Those who praise weapons  
enjoy killing others.  
Those who enjoy killing others  
achieve no stable rule.

If the left is the ritual place for joy  
and the right for sorrow,  
the commander is on the right,  
as at a funeral.

When you kill another,  
honour them with your tears.  
When the battle is won,  
treat it as a wake.
