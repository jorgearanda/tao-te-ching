# Chapter 29

Trying to improve the world by forceâ€”  
this will not work.  
The world is a spiritual thing;  
it cannot be forced.  
To force it is to harm it;  
to control it is to lose it.

Sometimes things lead,  
sometimes they follow.  
Sometimes they blow hot,  
sometimes cold.  
Sometimes they grow,  
sometimes they collapse.

So the wise avoid extremes,  
extravagance,  
and excess.
