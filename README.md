## Translation Note

This is a personal attempt at a translation of the [Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching).

I do not speak Classical Chinese, nor am I a philosopher or theologian.
I am merely comparing different translations into English
to try to make sense of the underlying meaning,
then distilling them into words that speak more clearly to me.
The result may well deviate from the original meaning of the text,
despite my intentions.

The translations I have consulted are from:

- Red Pine (available [here](https://terebess.hu/english/tao/Taoteching_withCommentaries.pdf); particularly useful due to its more literal approach and collection of commentaries)
- John C.H. Wu (available, along with the next seven, [here](https://www.bu.edu/religion/files/pdf/Tao_Teh_Ching_Translations.pdf))
- D.C. Lau
- Wing-tsit Chan
- Robert Henricks
- Arthur Waley
- Yutang Lin
- Thomas Cleary
- Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English
- Ursula LeGuin (available [here](http://www.sfhunyuan.com/images/TAO_TE_CHING_-_LE_GUIN_edition.pdf))
- Stephen Mitchell (available [here](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/5/25851/files/2016/02/taoteching-Stephen-Mitchell-translation-v9deoq.pdf))
- J.H. McDonald (available [here](https://www.unl.edu/prodmgr/NRT/Tao%20Te%20Ching%20-%20trans.%20by%20J.H..%20McDonald.pdf))
