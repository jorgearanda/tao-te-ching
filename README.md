### Note

This is a personal attempt at a translation of the [Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching).

I do not speak Classical Chinese, nor am I a philosopher or theologian.
I am merely comparing different translations
to try to make sense of the underlying meaning,
then distilling them into words that speak more clearly to me,
for my own study.
I am aware that the result may well deviate from the original meaning of the text.

The translations I have consulted so far are from:

- John C.H. Wu
- D.C. Lau
- Wing-tsit Chan
- Robert Henricks
- Arthur Waley
- Yutang Lin
- Thomas Cleary
- Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English
- Ursula LeGuin
- Stephen Mitchell
- J.H. McDonald
- Red Pine

The first eight translations are available as a single file [here](https://www.bu.edu/religion/files/pdf/Tao_Teh_Ching_Translations.pdf).

The LeGuin translation is available [here](http://www.sfhunyuan.com/images/TAO_TE_CHING_-_LE_GUIN_edition.pdf).
