### Note

This is a personal attempt at a translation of the [Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching).

I do not speak Classical Chinese, nor am I a philosopher or theologian.
I am merely comparing different translations
to try to make sense of the underlying meaning,
then distilling them into words that speak more clearly to me,
for my own study.
I am aware that the result may well deviate from the original meaning of the text.

The translations I have consulted so far are from Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English, Ursula LeGuin, and Stephen Mitchell.
