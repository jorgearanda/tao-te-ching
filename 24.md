# Chapter 24

Those on tiptoes do not stand firm.  
Those who rush do not go far.  
Those who watch themselves do not appear.  
Those who display themselves do not flourish.  
Those who flatter themselves do not succeed.  
Those who parade themselves do not lead.

On the Way, these are  
too much food and useless action.  
They bring no happiness.  
The wise shuns them.
