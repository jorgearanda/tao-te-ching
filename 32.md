# Chapter 32

The Way has never had a name.  
It is simple and small,  
yet no one can command it.  
If a ruler could hold onto it  
the world would be their guest.

When Heaven and Earth come together  
they bestow sweet dew upon us.  
No one gives the order,  
it comes down for all.

The division of the whole gave us names.  
Now that we have names,  
we should know to stop.  
Those who know to stop know no trouble.

The world is to the Way  
like rivers flowing into the sea.
