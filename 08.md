# Chapter 8

The best are like water:  
nourishing all without contention,  
resting in the lowest places others avoid,  
thus approaching the Way.

Dwelling with the earth.  
Thinking with depth.  
Helping with kindness.  
Speaking with truth.  
Governing with peace.  
Working with skill.  
Acting with timeliness.

They do not compete,  
so they are not maligned.
