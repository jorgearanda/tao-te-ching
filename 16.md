# Chapter 16

Let the limits be empty and the centre still.  
All things rise; watch them return to their roots.  
They return to their roots to be still.  
Being still they revive.  
Reviving they endure.

Knowing how to endure is wisdom.  
Not knowing is to suffer in vain.  
Knowing how to endure is to be all-embracing.  
All-embracing, one is just.  
Being just, one is regal.  
Being regal, one is heavenly.  
Being heavenly, one follows the Way.  
And though the self dies,  
it remains in the Way.
