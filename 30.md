# Chapter 30

Lead using the Way.  
Do not use weapons to rule:  
weapons turn on their wielders.  
Where armies camp, brambles grow.  
Where armies pass, bad years follow.

Best to win, then stop  
without further advantage.  
Win without pride.  
Win without vanity.  
Win without cruelty.  
Win when you have no choiceâ€”  
this is to win without force.

Virility leads to decay.  
That is not the Way,  
and what is not the Way dies early.
