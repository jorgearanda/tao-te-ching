# Chapter 33

Those who know others are perceptive.  
Those who know themselves are wise.  
Those who conquer others are forceful.  
Those who conquer themselves are strong.

Those who reach contentment are wealthy.  
Those who reach within are resolute.  
Those who are true to nature endure.  
Those who accept death live long enough.
