# Chapter 3

Not exalting the gifted prevents quarrels.  
Not collecting treasures prevents theft.  
Not displaying the desirable prevents disturbance.

The wise governs by clearing minds and stuffing bellies,  
by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.  
So those wanting become content  
and those knowing doubt their convictions.

Practice not-doing and all will be well.
