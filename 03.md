# Chapter 3

Bestowing no honours prevents quarrels.  
Prizing no treasures prevents theft.  
Displaying no attractions prevents disturbance.

The wise governs by clearing minds and stuffing bellies,  
by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.  
So those wanting become content  
and those knowing doubt their convictions.

Practice not-doing and all will be well.
