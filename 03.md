# Chapter 3

Not exalting the gifted prevents quarreling.  
Not collecting treasures prevents stealing.  
Not looking at the desirable prevents craving.

The wise governs by clearing minds and stuffing bellies,  
by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.  
So those wanting become content  
and those knowing doubt their convictions.

Practice not-doing and all will be well.
